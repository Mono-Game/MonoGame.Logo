Logo Usage Guidelines
=====================
The MonoGame logo is a [registered trademark](https://trademarks.justia.com/864/56/monogame-86456908.html) and is a brand for official MonoGame projects and content. The MonoGame logo **is not** part of the Ms-PL license of the MonoGame project itself.

Please refer to the following guidelines when using the MonoGame logos:

1. The MonoGame logo can be used to link to the MonoGame project and credit MonoGame in your own works.
2. The MonoGame logo can be used only as a secondary brand in your own works, meaning the average viewer should know that this is not a MonoGame website, project, or publication. In short, don't use the MonoGame logo as your own logo.
3. The MonoGame logo can be printed on promotional products, such as t-shirts, as long as it's a secondary brand as described in point 2.
4. The MonoGame logo of your choice must be used **unaltered and in original colors and typography**.
5. The MonoGame logo cannot be used on commercial products without explicit permission of the MonoGame team. Displaying the logo in your game credits is not considered commercial use.

If you have questions or doubts about your usage of the logo, please file an issue on this repository or contact the team.
